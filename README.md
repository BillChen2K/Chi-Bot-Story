# Chi-Bot
Mr. Chi simulator!

There is no difference between chatting with ChiBot and chatting with AlexChi [@skyzh](https://github.com/skyzh "Alex Chi")!

It can be an unprecedented perfect alternative when Alex Chi does not reply your message even though he has already read your message. You can even pretend to be Alex Chi in a group chat with this bot.

*NOTE: IT CAN NOT PROVIDE TECHNICAL HELP AS ALEX CHI DOES.*
